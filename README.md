# Preface  
**The directory is divided into 3 sections**  
<br>  
- **YT-version**: version with the standard YouTube player  
- **plyr-version**: version with the plyr.js player  
- **backend**: backend service (Python) — chose this language due to extensive experience with it, but I’d be happy to explore Node.js if needed  
---  
**General Information**  
Command to run: `npm run start`  

The entire project is written using the styled-components approach. A custom hook is used to track screen dimensions and orientation.  
The plyr.js video player was chosen for its visual appeal to users and customization capabilities.  
General styles were selected to harmonize with the UI library (Core UI).  
Significant attention was also paid to user usability.  

The backend is hosted on PythonAnywhere due to the server’s long lifespan, even on the free tier.  
The frontend is hosted on Vercel for its convenience and the wide range of features provided by the hosting service.
